# requirements.txt
#
# Purpose:
# - Define the Python dependencies needed to run the VisionQuery backend.
# - Keeping this file pinned (exact versions) makes builds reproducible:
#   same dependencies locally, in CI, and inside Docker.
#
# Notes:
# - FastAPI + Uvicorn power the API server.
# - transformers + torch provide the pretrained CLIP model for embeddings.
# - pillow is used to load images from disk safely.
# - numpy is used for cosine similarity in the in-memory vector store.
